# 2D-Cellular-Automata-Ecosystem

The main goal of this project is to study and analyse populations in a simple ecosystem
given a set of rules. To do this, three actors are used: a top-level predator (wolf), a low-level predator
(fox) and a herbivore (bunny). Utilizing a 2D grid, the agents will move semi-randomly while showing
interspecies and intraspecies behaviour, that is, either reproducing or hunting/getting hunt. Natural
selection will be discussed, a particular ecosystem will be analysed and a stable setting where all 3
actors survive will be found.
